Server-Side Rendering: Utilizes EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates for a fast and dynamic frontend experience.

Persistent Storage: Powered by MongoDB for secure and scalable data management.

MVC Architecture: Organized code structure separating Models, Views, and Controllers for professional-grade maintainability.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Frontend: EJS, CSS3, Bootstrap (for responsive UI)

Middleware: Multer (File Uploads), Express.js Body-Parser

Development Tools: Nodemon, Git/GitHub
